# Patatap-Clone

A project that culminates of the things I learned about the Front-End of a web application. This project is a clone of a visual sound kit application called Patatap. Additionally, this project uses the exact same sounds that Patatap uses. 


## Getting Started

You can either download the zip file or use git clone. Open the index.html file to see a live demo and press any alphabetical key on your keyboard to experience the rhythm of the sounds with random colored circle animations.
